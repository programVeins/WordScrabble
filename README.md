# WordScrabble

### 100DaysOfSwiftUI - Project 5

A silly little word scrabble game that prompts the user to make smaller words from a bigger root word, randomly selected from a huge array of words which is imported from the main bundle. Uses concepts like error, lists and UITextChecker from Obj-c era (meh) Your score is a tally of characters of all the words you've made ðŸ§©
